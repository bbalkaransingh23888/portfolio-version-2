Project Worksheet – Portfolio Site Version 2


Project Description: This site is a newer version of the portfolio I made previously. I intend for this one to be created using jQuery by itself. I also want to add some new features such as a Dark Mode. There will be a link to my previous Portfolio as well as GitHub Links to both repos so that anyone who stumbles upon this site can compare the code between the two. My hope is that this can highlight my growth over the past several months.

Wifreframes (I used the same design as my previous portfolio): https://github.com/bbalkaransingh23888/Project_1_Portfolio.git

 
MVP list:
1)	Interactive Buttons to navigate the page
2)	Display adaptation for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop views); Hamburger menu for the mobile display
3)	‘About Me’, ‘Projects’, ‘Contact’, and ‘Sites’ section in addition to brief introduction page
4)	Program the HTML to be loaded in via the DOM (jQuery)
5)	Flexbox and Grid for CSS
6)	‘About Me’ includes info. about who I am, work I’ve done, background, hobbies, etc.
7)	‘Projects’ section includes links to the projects as well as a small preview window thing…whatever that’s called
8)	‘Contact’ section includes my contact information, particularly my email and cell. It would include work contact info. in the future. I would also look to include an email registry here. 
9)	‘Sites’ include links to GitHub (personal and professional) and my personal Blog.
10)	 Deployment 
11)	 Link the email registry to Google sheet?; be able to pull in projects via API call from Google sheet?
12) Dark Mode - Switch between Light and Dark Mode instantly
13) Use nothing but jQuery - Basically, the goal is to not write anything directly into the HTML or CSS documents save for the boilerplate and body tags. 



Post-MVP: 
1)	Social Media links: Can go in one or both of the contact section or the footer
2)	Create a personal blog on my site -> utilize similar to post-MVP for ‘Projects’ section
